    2. Shipping Cost Based on Weight and Destination
    Problem:
    Write a program that calculates the shipping cost for a parcel based on its weight and destination:
    Weight <= 1kg: Local: $5 National: $8 International: $15 Weight> 1kg and <= 5kg: Local: $10 National: $15
            International: $30 Weight> 5kg and <= 10kg: Local: $20 National: $25 International: $50 Weight> 10kg:
                Local: $30
                National: $35
                International: $70
                Requirements:
                Input: Two variables for weight and destination
                Output: The total shipping cost
